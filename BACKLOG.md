# uniview Bug Backlog

> Source: full code review, 2026-07-07 (Claude Code session). Bugs marked **[REPRO]**

> Context: kunkun (the critical consumer) uses **worker mode + incremental (mutation)
> update mode** — P0 items all hit that exact path.

## Status snapshot (updated after the 2026-07-07 fix round)

**DONE in the fix round (commits a5b6b59..8b94f07 on main):** P0-1 (solid/tui
ports + anchor guards), P0-2 (protocol v3 text nodes — `#text` type, setText
by nodeId, all renderers/hosts updated), P0-3 (stable `${nodeId}:${propName}`
handler ids, per-node release, sweep; solid clear()-reuse fixed), P1 #4-#10
(root guard, Suspense via hidden nodes, destroy unmounts, error reporting
end-to-end + PluginHost banner, keydown passthrough, ws-clients rebuilt on
shared runtimes, bridge heartbeat + bounded host wait + message buffering,
nested-fn warning), quick wins #11-#13 (stats behind debug option,
MutableTree parent index, keyed each). Also: kkrpc 2.0 validated; all
localhost URLs pinned to 127.0.0.1 (IPv6 collision with other dev servers).

**STILL OPEN:**
- kunkun-side v3 adaptation (uiNodeChildren text nodes, sdk plugin-entry) — Phase 6
- ~~Swift demo hosts (appkit/macos) not adapted to protocol v3~~ **DONE** —
  both `UINode` models gained a `text` field + `#text` helpers; appkit
  `Mutation.setText` is now `(nodeId, text)` and `MutableUINodeTree.applySetText`
  addresses text nodes by id; appkit `NodeViewModel` and macOS `UINodeRenderer`
  fold/render `#text` nodes instead of dropping them as "Unknown". appkit Swift
  test suite updated + green (11 binaries via tests/run.sh); macOS renderer
  type-checks
- ~~solid incremental mode sends full tree per flush~~ **DONE** — the reconciler
  now emits a `setRoot` mutation whenever the plugin root attaches to / leaves
  the synthetic container, so the host seeds and stays in sync from mutations
  alone; full-tree backstop removed from the runtime (syncTree still available
  for explicit drift recovery)
- ~~#14 Zod validators dead code~~ **DONE** — drift fixed (removed the object
  `ExecuteHandlerRequestSchema` that never matched the positional RPC; added
  `MutationSchema`/`validateMutations` and `validateExecuteHandlerArgs`), wired
  opt-in dev validation into worker/websocket controllers (`validate: true`),
  tests added
- ~~#15 remaining misc cleanups~~ **DONE** — null props now preserved
  (react + solid serializeProps), dead `collectAppendChild` removed from
  react `appendInitialChild` + duplicate branch collapsed, registered-component
  slot now renders children in original order (no more text-first reorder),
  stale `textNodeId` doc comment fixed
- #16 kunkun sdk plugin-entry is still a third runtime bootstrap copy
- ~~#17 CI~~ **DONE** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: build+types+unit on
  ubuntu, Playwright e2e (Bun + chromium), AppKit host tests on macOS
- #18 e2e coverage gaps (reorder/text/keydown/crash/reconnect specs)

## Original status snapshot (as of 2026-07-07, pre-fix)

- `/Users/hk/Dev/uniview` checkout was 4 commits behind origin/main (`git pull` needed).
- The keyed-reorder detach fix (P0-1) exists **uncommitted** in the kunkun submodule
  working tree (`~/Dev/kunkun/vendors/uniview`): `react-renderer/src/reconciler/host-config.ts`,
  `host-sdk/src/mutable-tree.ts`, `host-svelte/src/ComponentRenderer.svelte`,
  plus `react-renderer/tests/keyed-reorder.test.tsx`. Needs commit + push upstream.
- Build gotcha discovered while debugging kill-process: `@kunkunsh/sdk` dist **inlines**
  react-renderer. Rebuild order: react-renderer → sdk → plugin bundle. host-sdk changes
  need a desktop dev-server restart.

## P0 — hits kunkun's production path (worker + incremental)

### 1. Keyed reorder: appendChild/insertBefore don't detach before insert — IN PROGRESS
React's commitPlacement reuses appendChild/insertBefore to MOVE existing keyed
instances. DOM insertBefore auto-detaches; an array-based host config must do it
explicitly, otherwise the node ends up in `children` twice → duplicate ids →
Svelte `each_key_duplicate` crash (first hit by kill-process fuse re-sorting).

- [x] Fix in react-renderer `host-config.ts` (uncommitted, kunkun submodule)
- [x] Fix in host-sdk `MutableTree` apply side (uncommitted, kunkun submodule)
- [ ] Commit + push both, bump kunkun submodule pointer
- [ ] **Port the same fix to solid-renderer** (`packages/solid-renderer/src/renderer/reconciler.ts:93-111`, `_insertNode`)
- [ ] **Port the same fix to tui-renderer** (`packages/tui-renderer/src/reconciler/host-config.ts:107-119`; also missing `child.parent = parent` there)
- [ ] Guard in `insertBefore`: after `detachFromParent(child)`, if `indexOf(beforeChild) === -1`
      the child is silently dropped (detached, never re-inserted). Unreachable per React's
      contract — which is exactly why it should throw/console.error instead of swallowing.

### 2. Text-node identity mismatch — one design flaw, three bugs **[REPRO]**
Full-tree serialization represents text children as **bare strings**
(`react-renderer/src/serialization/serialize.ts`), but mutations wrap them as
`{type:"text", id:"text-N", props:{}, children:[str]}` UINodes
(`react-renderer/src/mutation/mutation-collector.ts:110-118`). Consequences:

- (a) **insertBefore with a text-node anchor silently appends.** `beforeId` is `text-N`
  but host-side children are bare strings with no id → anchor never found →
  `MutableTree.applyInsertBefore` falls back to append → wrong order.
  Repro: `<div>{show && <span/>}tail</div>` toggling show → host gets `[TEXT, span]`,
  plugin truth is `[span, TEXT]`. No crash, just silently wrong — worse than P0-1.
- (b) **Dynamically appended text renders as "Unknown: text".** host-svelte
  `ComponentRenderer.svelte` has no `type:"text"` branch; kunkun's `uiNodeChildren()`
  filters strings only and drops `{type:"text"}` nodes as unknown components.
- (c) **setText childIndex corruption.** `applySetText` replaces the wrapper node with a
  bare string; the wrapper's id stays in `nodeIndex` forever (leak), and once host/plugin
  child arrays diverge (via (a)), childIndex-addressed setText mutates the wrong child —
  errors cascade.

**Fix direction:** unify text representation — make ALL text children `{type:"text"}`
nodes with stable ids (React Native's RawText approach), add a text branch to every host
renderer (host-svelte + kunkun renderers + react/vue demo hosts). Breaking →
**bump PROTOCOL_VERSION to 3**.

### 3. Handler lifecycle: React leaks, Solid fires the WRONG handler **[REPRO]**
- **React:** `serializeProps` registers a NEW handler id for every function on every
  serialize; `MutationCollector.cleanupHandlers()` is an empty shell (loop body is only
  comments). Registry never shrinks in either mode. Repro: 2 buttons × 10 re-renders →
  registry grows 2 → 22. Every keyed MOVE re-serializes the whole moved subtree →
  kill-process-style search (reorder per keystroke) grows the registry per keystroke.
- **Solid (worse):** `solid-runtime/src/runtime.ts:148` full mode calls
  `handlerRegistry.clear()` per update, and `clear()` resets `idCounter = 0` →
  **handler IDs are reused across renders**. A late-arriving `executeHandler("handler_3")`
  RPC (user clicked just before a re-render) executes a DIFFERENT function.
  Classic source of unreproducible "weird" bugs.

**Fix direction:** per-node handler tracking (`Map<nodeId, Set<handlerId>>`), release on
removeChild / setProps replacement; NEVER reset the id counter; keep one grace generation
for in-flight RPCs; unify React/Solid implementations.

---

## P1 — functional gaps & edge-case crashes

### 4. Root container supports exactly one child
`appendChildToContainer` overwrites `rootInstance`; `insertInContainerBefore` is **not
implemented**. A top-level Fragment `<><A/><B/></>` silently keeps only the last child;
reordering top-level children calls the missing method → TypeError. Same in solid/tui.
Minimum fix: throw a clear error on multiple root children.

### 5. Suspense unsupported → crash
`hideInstance` / `unhideInstance` / `hideTextInstance` missing from host config.
Any plugin using `React.lazy` / `<Suspense>` crashes on suspend. Either implement
(e.g. `hidden` flag on UINode) or detect + report a clear error.

### 6. destroy() never unmounts the React root
`react-runtime/src/runtime.ts` destroy() nulls references but never calls
`updateContainer(null)` → effects/timers live forever. Worker mode is saved by
`worker.terminate()`, but **WebSocket mode (long-lived Node plugin) leaks a whole live
React tree on every host reconnect** (each `initialize()` creates a fresh renderer,
old one keeps running), and **main mode leaks straight into the host page**.
Solid ws-client has the same reconnect subscription leak.

### 7. Error reporting is defined but never wired
`reportError` exists in the protocol; nothing on the plugin side ever calls it. No
`error`/`unhandledrejection` listeners in worker-entry/ws-client; React root error
callbacks are four bare `console.error`s (`react-renderer/src/reconciler/renderer.ts`).
A crashing plugin leaves the host showing stale "zombie" UI with zero indication.
`PluginHost.svelte` also never surfaces `getStatus().lastError`.

### 8. Keyboard events lose all key info on DOM elements (one-line fix)
host-svelte `ComponentRenderer.svelte` `wrapEventListener` returns `() => handler()` for
keydown/keyup — the event is dropped BEFORE `serializeHandlerArgs` (which has a perfectly
good `serializeKeyboardEvent`) ever sees it. Plugin `onKeyDown` receives `undefined`.
Registered-component path works fine → same API, two behaviors. Fix: pass the event through.

### 9. ws-client.ts is a drifted copy of runtime.ts
- Incremental mode sends **both** mutations AND a full tree on EVERY commit
  (`react-runtime/src/ws-client.ts:133`, comment says "initial render only" — it isn't).
  2× bandwidth, host applies mutations then gets clobbered by full init.
- Reconnect never unsubscribes old bridge callbacks → one dead closure set per reconnect.
- Solid's `updateProps` tears down and rebuilds the whole root (loses state);
  React's re-renders incrementally. Same protocol method, divergent semantics.
- Bridge server (`examples/bridge-server`): no ping/pong keepalive (half-open sockets
  linger for hours), hosts are insta-rejected while a plugin is down (no wait/queue).

**Fix direction:** reimplement ws-client on top of `createPluginRuntime` (single source of
truth); later, fold kunkun's `packages/sdk/src/runtime/plugin-entry.ts` (a third copy) in too.

### 10. Nested function props silently leak through raw
`serializeProps` only converts TOP-LEVEL `/^on[A-Z]/` function props to handler ids.
Functions nested in objects/arrays (Raycast-style `actions={[{onAction}]}`) stay raw in
props. kunkun avoids this by convention (actions as children), but nothing warns.
Minimum: dev-mode deep scan + `console.warn`.

---

## P2 — performance, robustness, hygiene

### 11. Benchmark stats run in the hot path
`runtime.ts` / `ws-client.ts` do `JSON.stringify(tree)` on EVERY commit just to count
bytes for `globalThis.__uniview_stats` → 2× serialization cost in production.
Gate behind an option/env flag, off by default.

### 12. MutableTree is O(tree) per mutation
`replaceNodeInTree` walks the whole tree per mutation; the new `findParentOf` (move
detach) is another full-tree scan per moved node → per-keystroke reorder of an N-row
list is O(n²). Cheap fix: maintain an `id → parentId` index (fill in `indexNode`),
making detach O(depth).

### 13. host-svelte `{#each node.children}` is unkeyed
Positional DOM reuse on reorder → input values/focus jump rows. Use
`{#each ... as child, i (typeof child === "string" ? i : child.id)}`.

### 14. Zod validators are dead code — and drifted — DONE
~~Nothing in any package calls `validateUINode`/`UINodeSchema`/etc., and
`ExecuteHandlerRequestSchema` (object shape) no longer matches the actual RPC signature
(two positional params).~~ Fixed: added `MutationSchema` (mirrors the v3 mutation
union), `validateMutations`/`isValidMutations`, and `validateExecuteHandlerArgs`
(positional); removed the misleading object schema. Wired opt-in dev validation
(`validate: true`) into the worker + websocket controllers via
`host-sdk/src/validate.ts` — plugin→host trees/mutations are checked against the
protocol schemas and reported through the error channel without blocking. Main
mode is exempt (serializes locally, tree well-formed by construction).

### 15. Misc cleanups — DONE
- ~~`appendInitialChild`'s `collectAppendChild` call~~ removed: it emitted
  appendChild mutations for a subtree whose parent isn't in the host tree yet
  (no-ops), while `collectSetRoot`/`collectAppendChild` capture the subtree whole
  when its root attaches. Duplicate `_isTextNode` if/else branch also collapsed.
- ~~`serializeProps` silently drops `null`-valued props~~ fixed in react + solid:
  `null` (a valid JSONValue, e.g. clearing a controlled input) is preserved;
  only `undefined` and non-`on[A-Z]` functions are dropped.
- ~~`mutations.ts` `textNodeId` doc reference~~ fixed.
- ~~Registered-component text-children hack~~ fixed: the host-svelte registered
  branch renders `node.children` in original order via `<Self>` (text nodes go
  through the TEXT_NODE_TYPE branch); `title` fallback is still derived from text
  children. No more all-text-before-all-elements reorder.

### 16. Three copies of the runtime bootstrap
`react-runtime/src/runtime.ts`, `react-runtime/src/ws-client.ts`, and kunkun's
`packages/sdk/src/runtime/plugin-entry.ts` are the same logic, each drifted differently
(see #9). Consolidate on `createPluginRuntime`.

---

## Infra / testing

### 17. No CI — DONE
~~`.github/workflows/` only has deploy-docs.~~ Added `ci.yml`: three jobs on
push/PR — (1) build + check-types + unit tests (ubuntu), (2) Playwright e2e
with Bun for the bridge server + chromium (uploads the `.reports/` html on
failure), (3) AppKit host `tests/run.sh` on macOS. Checkout uses
`submodules: recursive` for the workspace-linked vendor packages.

### 18. Test coverage gaps (aligned with the bugs above)
E2E (Playwright/Cypress) covers 3 hosts × 3 runtimes happy paths + benchmark, but NOT:
keyed reorders (benchmark only appends/removes), dynamically appended text nodes,
onKeyDown key payloads, plugin crash surfacing, ws disconnect/reconnect, memory growth.
Unit gaps: MutationCollector, serializeProps, HandlerRegistry have zero tests.
Known demo-host drift: react demo host doesn't convert style objects (svelte/vue do);
vue demo host reuses `withInputValue` for `<select>`.

## Appendix: repro tests for P0-2 / P0-3

Drop into `packages/react-renderer/tests/` (imports host-sdk's MutableTree via relative
path — adjust or move the MutableTree cases into host-sdk's tests when porting).
All three tests FAIL on current code (2026-07-07); flip them into regression tests as
the fixes land.
