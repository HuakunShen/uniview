## 17:58 - Standalone TUI React Reconciler MVP

- Core Decision/Topic: Build a standalone Ink-like React reconciler that renders directly to terminal (no plugin/RPC), using a fixed-layout renderer for a weekend MVP.
- Options Considered: (1) Use Ink as rendering backend, (2) build a host adapter for uniview, (3) build a standalone reconciler. Chose standalone reconciler to learn React reconciler internals and avoid plugin/RPC complexity.
- Final Decision & Rationale: Fixed layout + full redraw + keyboard-only input to keep scope small and implementation approachable within a few hours; defer Yoga flexbox and diffing.
- Key Changes Made: Added `packages/tui-renderer` with custom `react-reconciler` host config, terminal renderer, component API (`Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Newline`), and demo app in `examples/tui-demo`. Added deps for ANSI rendering and text width. Updated tsconfig/tsdown to match repo conventions.
- Future Considerations: Add Yoga flexbox layout, incremental diff rendering, mouse support, multiline input, scrollable lists, and resize handling.
