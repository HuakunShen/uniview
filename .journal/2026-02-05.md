## 17:58 - Standalone TUI React Reconciler MVP

- Core Decision/Topic: Build a standalone Ink-like React reconciler that renders directly to terminal (no plugin/RPC), using a fixed-layout renderer for a weekend MVP.
- Options Considered: (1) Use Ink as rendering backend, (2) build a host adapter for uniview, (3) build a standalone reconciler. Chose standalone reconciler to learn React reconciler internals and avoid plugin/RPC complexity.
- Final Decision & Rationale: Fixed layout + full redraw + keyboard-only input to keep scope small and implementation approachable within a few hours; defer Yoga flexbox and diffing.
- Key Changes Made: Added `packages/tui-renderer` with custom `react-reconciler` host config, terminal renderer, component API (`Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Newline`), and demo app in `examples/tui-demo`. Added deps for ANSI rendering and text width. Updated tsconfig/tsdown to match repo conventions.
- Future Considerations: Add Yoga flexbox layout, incremental diff rendering, mouse support, multiline input, scrollable lists, and resize handling.

## 20:13 - macOS Host Demo RPC + Renderer Fixes

- Core Decision/Topic: Fix host-side RPC protocol handling and renderer text/input behavior so the macOS demo matches the Svelte host output and button interactions work.
- Options Considered: (1) Keep callback-style handler invocations and relax `initialized` checks, (2) align with `HostToPluginAPI` request/response format. For text/input: (1) read only direct text children, (2) recursively flatten nested nodes and render label/value props for Input.
- Final Decision & Rationale: Align RPC handling with kkrpc’s request/response schema (`args: { result, error }`) and `executeHandler(handlerId, args)` request call; this ensures `initialize()` succeeds and handlers execute. Recursively extract text (to include inline spans) and render Input label/value to match plugin semantics.
- Key Changes Made: Updated response parsing and request construction in `examples/host-macos-demo/HostMacOSDemo/Services/RPCClient.swift`; adjusted `RPCMessage` args to handle object payloads in `examples/host-macos-demo/HostMacOSDemo/Models/RPCMessage.swift`; improved text extraction and Input rendering (label/value sync) in `examples/host-macos-demo/HostMacOSDemo/Views/UINodeRenderer.swift`; replaced invalid SF Symbol in `examples/host-macos-demo/HostMacOSDemo/ContentView.swift`.
- Future Considerations: Add integration tests for the bridge + macOS host, extend renderer coverage for more component props, and resolve SourceKit indexing warnings for local Swift module types.
